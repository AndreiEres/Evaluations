## Evidence
During the reporting I was mostly focused on the scalability and stability of the Polkadot network.

On the scalability side, the end goal is expanding the number of validators and cores to 1000 validators and 200 cores. To achieve that I've been directly involved in the following work streams that should remove existing known bottlenecks:

- Optimize and parallelize approval-voting subsystems:
  - https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4849
  - https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4848
  - https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4928
  - https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5411
- Increase the validators hardware specifications:
  - https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5127
  - https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1051
- Plan for gradually reaching 1000 validators on polkadot:
   - https://polkadot.subsquare.io/referenda/1200
   - https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/issues/5867


On the stability side, I've been doing the following things:
- Extend our tooling to help with debugging issues on live networks: https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-introspector/pull/794.
- I've been actively involved in debugging live issues on the main polkadot network E.g: [Parachain/Finality stalls](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/2024-09-17-polkadot-finality-lag-slow-parachain-production-immediately-after-runtime-upgrade-post-mortem/10057) & [Constant high finality](https://github.com/paritytech/project-mythical/issues/213#issuecomment-2297028051)
- Monitor production networks and validators channels and provide support when I can e.g: [Evidence1](https://matrix.to/#/!LhjZccBOqFNYKLdmbb:polkadot.builders/$172483314110VdvXX:parity.io?via=parity.io&via=matrix.org&via=corepaper.org), [Evidence2](https://matrix.to/#/!LhjZccBOqFNYKLdmbb:polkadot.builders/$17291518211dYsEi:parity.io?via=parity.io&via=matrix.org&via=corepaper.org), [Evidence3](https://matrix.to/#/!NZrbtteFeqYKCUGQtr:matrix.parity.io/$17265749343cYdwX:parity.io?via=parity.io&via=corepaper.org&via=matrix.org)
