## Evidence

| Areas of Contribution | Tasks  | Links   | Notes   |
|---|---|---|---|
| Polkadot SDK | Runtime Macro (CRV2) | [SDK 4769](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4769), [SDK 4643](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4643), [SDK 4249](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4249)  | While the runtime macro (Construct Runtime V2) was merged via [SDK 1378](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/1378), the work done during this period improved the syntax for pallet aliases and error handling.  |
| Polkadot SDK | `TypeWithDefault<T, D: Get<T>>` | [SDK 4034](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4034) | Adds the ability to provide a custom default for a type.  This can, then, be used to provide the nonce type that returns the current block number as the default, to avoid replay of immortal transactions.  |
| Polkadot SDK | Trigger tasks via unsigned transactions | [SDK 4075](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4075) | Adds the ability to allow valid tasks to be submitted as unsigned transactions.  |
| Polkadot SDK | Fix doc links with RA support | [SDK 5023](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5023) | Fixes the documentation for FRAME Macros when pointed from `polkadot_sdk_docs` crate. Also, adds RA support for them.  |
| Polkadot SDK | Templates | [SDK 4119](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4119), [SDK 5111](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/5111) | Various improvements in minimal and solochain templates.  |
| Polkadot SDK | FRAME Crate | [SDK 4370](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4370), [SDK 4406](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4406) | Publish frame crate and minor improvements. |
| Polkadot SDK | Default Configs | [SDK 4689](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/pull/4689) | Removes production configs as discussed in [FORUM 7584](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/seeking-feedback-on-derive-impl-for-default-configurations-in-pallet-templates/7584/1).
